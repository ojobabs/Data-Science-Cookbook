# U.S. Population projections at County level

As you can see ([here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj/guidance.html)), the U.S. Census Bureau, only provides population projections at Country level and not County level. For example, [here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popproj/2017-summary-tables.html), you have on the Table 3 the detailed age and sex composition population at Country level for 2020, 2025, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2055 and 20160.

In summary, there is no official U.S. Census Bureau population projections at County level.

> Note: Don't confuse the 50-years estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) that also Claritas provides. [Here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html) you can read that this is just 60 months of collected asta from, for example, 2014-2018. But these data are no forecasted data. This is only for the current time. You can read more about that [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html).

There are, by the way, population projections at State level, but in this case, are the states who realese those projections.

Here you have the main page for U.S. Census population projections:
- [Population Projections](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj.html)

Nevertheless, I've found some resources that provides Population projections at County level. I've fond the following article [Population projections for U.S. counties by age, sex, and race controlled to shared socioeconomic pathway](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20195#ref17), recently published on Nature that provide population estimations at County level by:

- Age
- Sex
- Race

> Notice that this article maybe is not useful because it uses 5 "shared socioeconomic pathways". More on the article.

The article provides R code, the data:

To download the data, download the zip file `SSP+asrc.zip` file. This a large file.

On the article [Comparing Artificial Neural Network and Cohort-Component Models for Population Forecasts](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e637/df4fbac34e35c08a42bbb9838ca56f804fd3.pdf), we used for the Shark Tank competition in NYL, maybe there is more data. But I'am afraid that it is a County level but only for one State and not country while.

Finally, there is a company that sell projections at County level:

[**Demographic Trends 2010-2060**](http://proximityone.com/demographics2060.htm). They are using time series analysis to make the projections at county level. The price is between $500 and $1,300.

Here you have another company doing something similar:

 ## ESRI 5 years projections
- [https://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/data/updated-demographics.htm](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/data/updated-demographics.htm)
- [http://downloads.esri.com/esri_content_doc/dbl/us/Variable_List-Esri_2019_and_2024_Updated_Demographics.pdf](http://downloads.esri.com/esri_content_doc/dbl/us/Variable_List-Esri_2019_and_2024_Updated_Demographics.pdf)

It seems that the above **update demographic** product is part of the Data coming with ESRI Arc
