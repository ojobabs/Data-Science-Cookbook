# U.S. Population projections at County level

As you can see ([here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj/guidance.html)), the U.S. Census Bureau, only provides population projections at Country level and not County level. For example, [here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popproj/2017-summary-tables.html), you have on the Table 3 the detailed age and sex composition population at Country level for 2020, 2025, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2055 and 20160.

In summary, there is no official U.S. Census Bureau population projections at County level.

> Note: Don't confuse the 50-years estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) that also Claritas provides. [Here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html) you can read that this is just 60 months of collected asta from, for example, 2014-2018. But these data are no forecasted data. This is only for the current time. You can read more about that [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html).

Nevertheless, I've found some resources that provides Population projections at County level. I've fond the following article [Population projections for U.S. counties by age, sex, and race controlled to shared socioeconomic pathway](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20195#ref17), recently published on Nature that provide population estimations at County level by:

- Age
- Sex
- Race
