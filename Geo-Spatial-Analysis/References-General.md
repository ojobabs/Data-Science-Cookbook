### Merging ZIP codes with Census Tracts

- [United States ZIP codes.org](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/) At the bottom of the page there is a section called   [Downloadable ZIP Code List](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/) from where it is possible to download the full US data base, that is, all zip codes and their equivalent counties and the centroid (lat and long) for each zip code.

### Google API for geocoding and routing capabilities

I need to provide any resource about how to start using Google API

Also, the ESRI book about hotspot analysis, that's an interesting approach to find the optimal location

we have that read book too.

Some viedeos about how to start using machine learning with spatial data from Esri the one I've sent to Sassoon.
