### Google API for geocoding and routing capabilities

I need to provide any resource about how to start using Google API

Also, the ESRI book about hotspot analysis, that's an interesting approach to find the optimal location

we have that read book too.

Some viedeos about how to start using machine learning with spatial data from Esri the one I've sent to Sassoon.

### Spatial Machine Learning

Some information about solving the optimal location problem from diffe
