Summary:

- The Generate Origin Destination Cost Matrix service tool creates an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations.
- OD cost matrix is a table that contains the **travel time** and **travel distance** from each origin to each destination.
- Additionally, it ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum time or distance required to travel from that origin to each destination.
- The best path on the street network is discovered for each origin-destination pair, and the travel times and travel distances are stored as attributes of the output lines.
