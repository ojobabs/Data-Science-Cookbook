### [Does Y mean latitude and X mean longitude in every GIS software?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/11626/does-y-mean-latitude-and-x-mean-longitude-in-every-gis-software)

For ESRI its almost always going to be:

Lat = Y Long = X

### Measuring distance between to points using Python

- [https://python-forum.io/Thread-Formula-works-for-one-row-does-not-for-two](https://python-forum.io/Thread-Formula-works-for-one-row-does-not-for-two) If you you Pandas dataframe you need to change the math library by the numpy library. 
- [Pandas: calculate haversine distance within each group of rows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43577086/pandas-calculate-haversine-distance-within-each-group-of-rows)

Determines whether to calculate the distance using a planar (flat earth) or a geodesic (ellipsoid) method.

-   **Planar**—Planar measurements use 2D Cartesian mathematics to calculate length and area. The option is only available when measuring in a projected coordinate system and the 2D plane of that coordinate system will be used as the basis for the measurements.
-   **Geodesic** (Harversine)—The shortest line between two points on the earth's surface on a spheroid (ellipsoid). Therefore, regardless of input or output projection, the results do not change.

>##### Note:
>
> One use for a geodesic line is when you want to determine the shortest distance between two cities for an airplane's flight path. This is also known as a great circle line if based on a > sphere rather than an ellipsoid.
