### Clip Tool

The `Input Features` must be the larger layer. The following video explain that clearly:

- [How to Clip a Data Layer in ArcMap 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UF0l8Ly2U4)

### Export data in geodatabase: Export a feature layer to a shapefile

To export a feature layer that is part of a geodatabase to a shapefile outside of the geodatabase, go to Catalog, select the feature layer to export, and then select export and then select `Feature Class(es) To Shapefile(s)`.

- [Export data in a geodatabase](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/export-data.htm)

### Obtaining all block groups withing the service area

There are two approaches to get the block groups within the calculated service area:

1. Using clip or intersection tool
2. Using [select by location](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/map/working-with-layers/using-select-by-location.htm)

By using select by local we have the operators `intersect`, `are within` or `are completely within` to select block groups that intersect with the service are or are withing the service area.

### Density-based Clustering: DBSCAN, HDBSCAN and OPTICS

- [Denisty-based Clustering in ArcGIS PRO](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/densitybasedclustering.htm)
- [How density-based clustering works ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/how-density-based-clustering-works.htm)
- [A clear explanation of DBSCAN on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jl9KkmgDIw)
- [Another clear explanation of DBSCAN on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKRUfsc8zp4)
- [Brian Kent: Density Based Clustering in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cOhL4B5waU). This person has an interesting master or phd thesis about density based clustering [here](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/documents/kent_dissertation.pdf). Also, he wrote some python packages. 

### Transfer local market to a standard geography (block-group)

Aim: once we have the local market polygone obtained by using the Network Analysis tool, we need to translate that polygone into a standard geography - block group level. To to this there are at least two options:

1. Use the [Enrich Layer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/analysis/enrich-layer.htm) tool.  I am using as input the Local Market layer inside the ServiceArea folder. 

- For D21 (New Orleans) the population density is 2,399.5. 
- For D18 (Louisiana) the population density is 1,033.9.
- For S96 (Wyoming) the population density is 560.4
- For V69 (Manhattan) the population density is 21,613.9

The aggregation method is block groups. 

Apparently, it is work. Let's automate the code to get the driving time by population density plot.

2. First, we can download from the U.S. Census Bureau the block-group geometry  shapefiles for each State and then doing a spatial join or something link that get the right shapefile.
3. The ideal tool is [Generate Geographies from Overlay]([https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/business-analyst/generate-geographies-from-overlay.htm](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/business-analyst/generate-geographies-from-overlay.htm)) . But as you can see [here]([https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in-arcgis-pro-2-3.htm](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in-arcgis-pro-2-3.htm)) only exist on ArcGIS Pro 2.3. Our current version is 2.2.3. 
4. There is another option, using the [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/#d=2&q=%22ACS%20Population%20Variables%20-%20Boundaries%22), but the [available layer](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f430d25bf03744edbb1579e18c4bf6b8) doesn't come at Block-Group level.
5. The ideal tool is . But as you can see [here]([https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in-arcgis-pro-2-3.htm](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in-arcgis-pro-2-3.htm)) only exist on 

### How To: Count the number of point features within a polygon

- [Reference](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000008599)

Target: the polygon layer
Join Features: the point data layer

![enter image description here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ist-app-support-files/000008599/00N39000003LL2C-0EMf20000001nAJ.png)

### Create a point layer with all points inside a polygon

You can use this:
- [Find-what-intersects-a-feature](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/tables/find-what-intersects-a-feature.htm)

or this

- [Find-what-is-inside-a-polygon](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/tables/find-what-is-inside-a-polygon.htm)

- Target Feature: point layer
- Join Feature: polygon layer
- Keep all target features: NO
- Match Option: either intersect or completely within
