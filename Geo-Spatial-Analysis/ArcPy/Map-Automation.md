## Intro

It seems that the `arcpy.mapping` module it is useful when you create only one map manually, using the GUI tool, and then by using `arcpy.mapping`, you can modify that map document programmatically. Therefore, you need to develop a first map manually for a GO office and then, automate for the remaining more than 100 offices.
