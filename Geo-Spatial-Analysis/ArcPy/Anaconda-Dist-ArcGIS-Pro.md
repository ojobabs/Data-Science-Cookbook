# Anaconda Distribution in ArcGIS Pro



We could not install new packages on the default Anacoda distribution that comes with ArcGIS Pro 2.2.. One possibility could be installing a new Anaconda distribution. And then, add whatever the packages we need. In fact, it is possible to download `ArcPy` from the Anaconda cloud: [arcpy](https://anaconda.org/Esri/arcpy).
