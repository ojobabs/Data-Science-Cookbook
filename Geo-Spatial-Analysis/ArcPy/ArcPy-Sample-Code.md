### Remove any kind of data from geodatabase

See how we can use the `*` wildcard to remove data:
```python
# Use the ListFeatureClasses function to return a list 
# of feture classes.
featureclasses = arcpy.ListFeatureClasses('location*')

# Iterawte over the dictinory to print the name of each 
# feture class
for fc in featureclasses:
    arcpy.management.Delete(fc)
    print(f'Removing data from geodatabse: {fc}')
```


### Selecting maximum Value based on other field by group?

The following algorithm is do the following:

1. It uses the `Intersect()` function from `arcpy` to get all client locations (points) inside the local market (polygon).
2. It uses `SearchCorsor()`  function from `arcpy` to take a list of unique [marketer_id, address_type] pair values. We have two locations per agent, the business (location) and the residential location. Therefore, we need to create a list of unique pairs. This is the interesting part of this code. The code on the below reference web page uses one field instead of two. 
3. It uses `SearchCorsor()`  function from `arcpy` to for every unique [marketer_id, address_type] pair, make a list of unique  # distances values and get the maximum value
