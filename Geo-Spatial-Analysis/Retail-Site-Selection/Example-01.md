# Retail Site Selection Example: 01

Reference: from chapter 10 "Spatial Analytics with ArcGIS".

- Lone Stone Realty, a fictional real estate brokerage located in the Stone Oak area of San
Antonio, Texas.
- Using **sales** information for the past year, they would like to get a better understanding of the underlying geographic patterns that influence their business, guide their **potential expansion efforts**, and assist with marketing efforts.
- Lone Star Realty currently has a single office location in the Stone Oak area and a large
percentage of their business is conducted in this area.
- The brokerage focuses on assisting buyers and sellers within a price range of $250,000 to $400,000, and for the most part, within a roughly **5 square miles radius of the neighborhood**.
- The client is also interested in the possibility of expansion through the opening of a new office somewhere on the north side of the metropolitan area. Because they have been
successful assisting buyers and sellers in this price range, they want to find a location that is
similar to the existing Stone Oak location in terms of real estate characteristics.
