# Minkowski Distance Estimation

The following notes summarizes the article:  ["Comparison of distance measures in spatial analytical modeling for health service planning"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781002/).

- Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling.
