# Minkowski Distance Estimation

The following notes summarizes the article:  ["Comparison of distance measures in spatial analytical modeling for health service planning"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781002/).

> **Summary*8: The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively.

- Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling.
## Methods

- **Road distance** and **travel time** are calculated from the postal code of residence of each patient undergoing cardiac catheterization to the pertinent hospital.
- The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively.
- Distance estimates and distance measurements are then compared using descriptive statistics and visual mapping methods.
