- From column to row: `CTRL` + `A` selects all. Then `CTRL` + `J` aligns them in a row.

#### From Row to Column:

Example: 
Let's say we have something like this:
```
['marketer_id', 'calendar_year', 'calendar_date', 'registered_edt']
```

- Go to Search, Find, Replace. Find `,`, Replace `$1\n`, SearchMode: `Regular Expression`. The Find: `,` represent the comma on the above list, it is the separator we want to use.

['marketer_id', 
'calendar_year',
