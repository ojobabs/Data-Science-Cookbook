# Git for Data Scientists

## Basic Workflow

### What is version control?

A  **version control system**  is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist; this lesson focuses on one called Git, which is used by many of the data science tools covered in our other lessons. Its strengths are:

-   Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.
    
-   Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.
    
-   Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.
    

Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git.

### Where does Git store information?

Each of your Git projects has two parts: the files and directories that you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. The combination of these two things is called a  **repository**.

Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called  `.git`  located in the root directory of the repository. Git expects this information to be laid out in a very precise way, so you should never edit or delete anything in  `.git`.

---

Suppose your home directory `/home/repl` contains a repository called `dental`, which has a sub-directory called `data`. Where is information about the history of the files in `/home/repl/dental/data`stored?

  Answers
- [ ]  `/home/repl/.git`
- [X] `/home/repl/dental/.git`
- [ ] `/home/repl/dental/data/.git`
- [ ] None of the above.

### How can I check the state of a repository?

When you are using Git, you will frequently want to check the  **status**  of your repository. To do this, run the command  `git status`, which displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved.

---
You have been put in the `dental`repository. Use `git status` to discover which file(s) have been changed since the last save. Which file(s) are listed?

##### Possible Answers

- [ ]   `data/summer.csv`.
    
-   [X] `report.txt`.
    
-   [ ] Neither of the above.
    
-   [ ] Both of the above.

### How can I tell what I have changed?

Git has a  **staging area**  in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet. Putting files in the staging area is like putting things in a box, while  **committing**  those changes is like putting that box in the mail: you can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5355/datasets/staging-area.png)

`git status` shows you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there. In order to compare the file as it currently is to what you last saved, you can use `git diff filename`. `git diff` without any filenames will show you all the changes in your repository, while `git diff directory` will show you the changes to the files in some directory.

---

You have been put in the `dental`repository. Use `git diff` to see what changes have been made to the files.

```git
$ git diff
diff --git a/data/northern.csvb/data/northern.csv
index 5eb7a96..5a2a259 100644
--- a/data/northern.csv
+++ b/data/northern.csv

 2017-08-13,wisdom
 2017-09-07,molar
+2017-11-01,bicuspid
```
### What is in a diff?

A  **diff**  is a formatted display of the differences between two sets of files. Git displays diffs like this:

```git
diff --git a/report.txt b/report.txt
index e713b17..4c0742a 100644
--- a/report.txt
+++ b/report.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-# Seasonal Dental Surgeries 2017-18
+# Seasonal Dental Surgeries (2017) 2017-18
```

This shows:

-   The command used to produce the output (in this case,  `diff --git`). In it,  `a`  and  `b`are placeholders meaning "the first version" and "the second version".
-   An index line showing keys into Git's internal database of changes. We will explore these in the next chapter.
-   `--- a/report.txt`  and  `+++ b/report.txt`, which indicate that lines being  _removed_ are prefixed with  `-`, while lines being added are prefixed with  `+`.
-   A line starting with  `@@`  that tells where the changes are being made. The pairs of numbers are  `start line,number of lines changed`. Here, the diff output shows that 4 lines from line 1 are being removed and replaced with new lines.
-   A line-by-line listing of the changes with  `-`  showing deletions and  `+`  showing additions. (We have also configured Git to show deletions in red and additions in green.) Lines that  _haven't_  changed are sometimes shown before and after the ones that have in order to give context; when they appear, they  _don't_  have either  `+`  or  `-`in front of them.

Desktop programming tools like  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)  can turn diffs like this into a more readable side-by-side display of changes; you can also use standalone tools like  [DiffMerge](https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/)  or  [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/).

---

You have been put in the  `dental`repository. Use  `git diff data/northern.csv`  to look at the changes to that file. How many lines have been changed?

```git
$ cd dental
$ git diff data/northern.csv
diff --git 
a/data/northern.csv

##### Possible Answers

-  [ ] None.
    
-   [X] 1.

### What's the first step in saving changes?

You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:

1.  Add one or more files to the staging area.
2.  Commit everything in the staging area.

To add a file to the staging area, use  `git add filename`.

---

You have been put in the `dental`repository. Use `git add` to add the file `report.txt` to the staging area.

```git
$ cd dental
$ git add report.txt
```

Use another Git command to check the repository's status.

Let's see what happens before and after using `git add`:
```git
$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   report.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add report.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   report.txt
```

### How can I tell what's going to be committed?

To compare the state of your files with those in the staging area, you can use  `git diff -r HEAD`. The  `-r`  flag means "compare to a particular revision", and  `HEAD`  is a shortcut meaning "the most recent commit".

You can restrict the results to a single file or directory using  `git diff -r HEAD path/to/file`, where the path to the file is relative to where you are (for example, the path from the root directory of the repository).

We will explore other uses of  `-r`  and  `HEAD`  in the next chapter.

---

You have been put in the `dental`repository, where `data/northern.csv` has been added to the staging area. Use `git diff` with `-r` and an argument to see how files differ from the last saved revision.

```git
$ git diff -r HEAD
diff --git a/data/eastern.csv b/data/eastern.csv
index b3c1688..85053c3 100644

Use a single Git command to view the changes in the file that has been staged (and _only_ that file).

```git
$ git diff -r HEAD data/northern.csv
diff --git a/data/northern.csv b/data/northern.csv
index 5eb7a96..5a2a259 100644

```

`data/eastern.csv`  hasn't been added to the staging area yet. Use a Git command to do this now.

```git
$ git add data/eastern.csv
```

### Interlude: how can I edit a file?

Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors. In this course, we will sometimes use a very simple one called Nano. If you type  `nano filename`, it will open  `filename`  for editing (or create it if it doesn't already exist). You can then move around with the arrow keys, delete characters with the backspace key, and so on. You can also do a few other operations with control-key combinations:

-   Ctrl-K: delete a line.
-   Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
-   Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
-   Ctrl-X: exit the editor.

---

Run  `nano names.txt`  to edit a new file in your home directory and enter the following four lines:

```
Lovelace
Hopper
Johnson
Wilson
```

To save what you have written, type Ctrl-O to write the file out, then Enter to confirm the filename, then Ctrl-X and Enter to exit the editor.

### How do I commit changes?

To save the changes in the staging area, you use the command  `git commit`. It always saves everything that is in the staging area as one unit: as you will see later, when you want to undo changes to a project, you undo all of a commit or none of it.

When you commit changes, Git requires you to enter a  **log message**. This serves the same purpose as a comment in a program: it tells the next person to examine the repository why you made a change.

By default, Git launches a text editor to let you write this message. To keep things simple, you can use  `-m "some message in quotes"`  on the command line to enter a single-line message like this:

```
git commit -m "Program appears to have become self-aware."

```

If you accidentally mistype a commit message, you can change it using the  `--amend`  flag.

```
git commit --amend - m "new message"
``` 
---

You have been put in the `dental`repository, and `report.txt` has been added to the staging area. Use a Git command to check the status of the repository.

```git
$ cd dental
$ git add report.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   report.txt

```

Commit the changes in the staging area with the message "Adding a reference."

```git
$ git commit -m "Adding a reference."
```

### How can I view a repository's history?

The command  `git log`  is used to view the  **log**  of the project's history. Log entries are shown most recent first, and look like this:

```
commit 0430705487381195993bac9c21512ccfb511056d
Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 20 13:42:26 2017 +0000

    Added year to report title.

```

The  `commit`  line displays a unique ID for the commit called a  **hash**; we will explore these further in the next chapter. The other lines tell you who made the change, when, and what log message they wrote for the change.

When you run  `git log`, Git automatically uses a pager to show one screen of output at a time. Press the space bar to go down a page or the 'q' key to quit.

----------

You are in the directory  `dental`, which is a Git repository. Use a single Git command to view the repository's history. What is the message on the very first entry in the log (which is displayed last)?

### How can I view a specific file's history?

A project's entire log can be overwhelming, so it's often useful to inspect only the changes to particular files or directories. You can do this using  `git log path`, where  `path`  is the path to a specific file or directory. The log for a file shows changes made to that file; the log for a directory shows when files were added or deleted in that directory, rather than when the contents of the directory's files were changed.

----------

You have been put in the  `dental`  repository. Use  `git log`  to display only the changes made to  `data/southern.csv`. How many have there been?

```git
$ git log data/southern.csv

-   [ ] 3.

### How do I write a better log message?

Writing a one-line log message with  `git commit -m "message"`is good enough for very small changes, but your collaborators (including your future self) will appreciate more information. If you run  `git commit`_without_  `-m "message"`, Git launches a text editor with a template like this:

```
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   skynet.R
#

```

The lines starting with  `#`  are comments, and won't be saved. (They are there to remind you what you are supposed to do and what files you have changed.) Your message should go at the top, and may be as long and as detailed as you want.

---

You have been put in the `dental`repository, and `report.txt` has been added to the staging area. The changes to `report.txt` have already been staged. Use `git commit`  _without_  `-m` to commit the changes. The Nano editor will open up. Write a meaningful message and use Ctrl+O and Ctrl+X to save and leave the editor.

### How does Git store information?

You may wonder what information is stored by each commit that you make. Git uses a three-level structure for this.

1.  A  **commit**  contains metadata such as the author, the commit message, and the time the commit happened. In the diagram below, the most recent commit is at the bottom (`feed0098`), and vertical arrows point up towards the previous ("parent") commits.
2.  Each commit also has a  **tree**, which tracks the names and locations in the repository when that commit happened. In the oldest (top) commit, there were two files tracked by the repository.
3.  For each of the files listed in the tree, there is a  **blob**. This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened. (Blob is short for  _binary large object_, which is a SQL database term for "may contain data of any kind".) In the middle commit,  `report.md`  and  `draft.md`  were changed, so the blobs are shown next to that commit.  `data/northern.csv`  didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit. Reusing blobs between commits help make common operations fast and minimizes storage space.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5355/datasets/commit-tree-blob.png)

Looking at the diagram, which files changed in the most recent commit to this repository?

##### Possible Answers

- [X]  `data/northern.csv`
    
-  [ ] `report.md`
    
-  [ ] `draft.md`

### What is a hash?

Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a  **hash**  (since it is generated by running the changes through a pseudo-random number generator called a  **hash function**). This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like  `7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93`, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.

Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.

----------

Use  `cd`  to go into the  `dental`  directory and then run  `git log`. What are the first four characters of the hash of the most recent commit?

```git
$ cd dental$ git logcommit 610de9192eb50716c2447622bc36d19873f54554
