### Git global setup

```bash
git config --global user.name "Marcos"
git config --global user.email "marcos_aguilerakeyser@newyorklife.com"
```

### Create a new repository

```bash
git clone git@nylgit.newyorklife.com:CDSA/cross-sell-up-sell-leads-from-agent-bob.git
cd cross-sell-up-sell-leads-from-agent-bob
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "add README"
git push -u origin master
```
### Existing folder or Git repository

```bash
cd existing_folder
git init
git remote add origin git@nylgit.newyorklife.com:CDSA/cross-sell-up-sell-leads-from-agent-bob.git
git add .
git commit
git push -u origin master
```

### Remove directory from remote repository

```bash
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m 'Remove the now ignored directory node_modules'
git push origin master
```

### [Git's rejected push error](https://blog.plover.com/prog/git-ff-error.html)

When the following error arise after using `git push origin master`:


```
! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)  
    error: failed to push some refs to '../remote/'  
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do  
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing  
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes  
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.  
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.  
```
The steps to follow are:

First: git fetch origin master using:

```
git fetch origin master
```

Second: Rewrite the local changes:

```
git rebase origin/master
```

Third: Try the push again:

```
git push origin master
```

### Remove a file from a  Git repository

If the file is on the local repository use `git_rm`:

```
git rm file.txt
git commit -m "Remove file1.txt"
```

But if you want to remove the file only from the remote Git repository and not remover it from the filesystem, use:

```
git rm --cached file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
```
And to push changes to remote repo:

```
git push origin master
```

###  git init

This initializes a new Git repository, and you'll notice that it creates a `.git` folder so that you can start your project (this is hidden by default on Unix-based and Windows operating systems).

### git clone

The other situation you might find yourself in is working on an existing project and needing to create a local repository. This can be done with the `git clone` command. You specify a URL with a protocol (such as https:// or git://) and Git fetches all of the information for that repository before putting it in a folder for that project. It also constructs a working copy from the latest commit on master so that you can begin working on the files immediately.

### git add

### Creates a working repository using Git

```bash

```

### How to stop tracking and ignore changes to a file in Git - Create a `.gitignore` file
First create a `.gitignore` file:
```bash
project $ touch .gitignore
```
Then add the name of the file or files you want to ignore:
```bash
project $ echo ".remote-sync.jason" > .gitignore
```
Now Git stops tracking the file `.remote-sync.jason`. The `.gitignore` file is also ignored.

If you want to ignore all files with an specific extension, for example, `.txt` files, just use:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt" > .gitignore
```
You can also ignore all files with the same path on the title, for example, all files starting by `video.`:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt video.*" > .gitignore
```
Or just video on their titles:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt video*" > .gitignore
```
In order to ignore folders:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt Temp/" > .gitignore
```
The `/` signify that `Temp` is a directory. Adding a * ignores all files in that directory:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt Temp/*" > .gitignore
```
If you want to ignore all Temp folders within the folder:
```bash
project $ echo "*.txt */Temp/*" > .gitignore
```

### How can I determine the URL that a local Git repository was originally cloned from?
If you want only the remote URL, or referential integrity has been broken:
```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```
This is the output:
```bash
https://gitlab.com/magkey/test_project.git
```
If you require full output or referential integrity is intact:
```bash
git remote show origin
```
When using `git clone` (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using `git remote show` will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:
```bash
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://gitlab.com/magkey/test_project.git
  Push  URL: https://gitlab.com/magkey/test_project.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':

    master pushes to master (up to date)
```
[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089430/how-can-i-determine-the-url-that-a-local-git-repository-was-originally-cloned-fr)

### Create a new branch

```git
# See a list of current branches in the repo
git branch

# Create a new branch called BRANCH_NAMEgit branch BRANCH_NAME
git branch BRANCH_NAME

# Switch to the BRANCH_NAME branch
git checkout BRANCH_NAME

# Create and switch to a branch called BRANCH_NAME
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME

# Merge OTHER_BRANCH into the current branch
git merge OTHER_BRANCH

# Make sure you are on the `master` branch
git checkout master

# Merge the `experiment` branch into the current (`master`) branch
git merge experiment

# Push the current branch to the BRANCH_NAME branch on the `origin`
# remote (GitHub)
git push origin BRANCH_NAME

# Push to the BRANCH_NAME branch on origin, enabling remote tracking
# The -u creates an association between the local and remote branches
git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
```


### [Git log to get commits only for a specific branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14848274/git-log-to-get-commits-only-for-a-specific-branch)

From what it sounds like you should be using `cherry`:

```git
$ git cherry -v master traditional
```
Example:
```git
t93kqi0@IAG-MAGUI-KQ10 MINGW64 ~/Documents/Projects/Agent-Screening (traditional)
$ git cherry -v master traditional
+ 8be0467d1597af1b26ef371c23cac74415f77b30 Add code\binning_efd.py to apply equally frequency discretization to train, test and validation data. The data have been created for 3 and 6 bins.
+ 12b990690912f11ae18cdb9bdc1f37caa9820079 Add documents\analysis-traditional-economentric-approach-v01.xls with the variables inlcuded in the traditional approach.
+ 8e6723af883136261914acdcd36c3145edc4c463 Add code\pipeline-01.py with the corresponding data
+ 3439e2de2a2a98caf7c3afc525552062ec774b3e Add code\pipeline-01.py with the corresponding data
+ 80e80a3b78ad9fff8ff7082e2e5a863c4d8de271 Add code\pipeline-03.py and all corresponding data
+ 796f882c018b5a218d00c50de8cd24f4961b125d Add code\pipeline-03.py and all corresponding data
+ 0d423c6deeb87f28c41f6e1639ccfe3b69adfbaf Add code\pipeline-05.py with remaining and corresponding data
```
This would show all of the commits which are contained within  _traditional_, but NOT in  _master_. If you leave off the last option (_traditional_), it will compare the current branch instead.

You are ALWAYS comparing your branch to another branch, so know your branches and then choose which one to compare to.

The log is listed in chronological order. 

Another way using:

```git
$ git log --graph traditional
```
Example:
```git
t93kqi0@IAG-MAGUI-KQ10 MINGW64 ~/Documents/Projects/Agent-Screening (traditional)
$ git log --graph traditional

### [How to fetch all Git branches](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10312521/how-to-fetch-all-git-branches)

If you clone a repository that comes with different branches you need to do the following:

```bash
$ git clone repository 
```
And then
```bash
$ git fetch --all
```
Now if you do
```bash
$ git branch -r
```
You can see all the branches

Finally, you can move the the branch you want doing

```bash
$ git checkout name_of_branch
```
