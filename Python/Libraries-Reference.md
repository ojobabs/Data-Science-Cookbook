## Python Libraries References

### [yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/about.html)

This library is used on this book "[Applied Text Analysis with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Text-Analysis-Python-Language-Aware-ebook/dp/B07DNKHJL8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1BJJ5JXU3WHPW&keywords=applied+text+analysis+with+python&qid=1551031889&s=gateway&sprefix=Applied+Text+%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-1)". 

Yellowbrick is an open source, pure Python project that extends the scikit-learn [API](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) with visual analysis and diagnostic tools. [Here](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/index.html) you can find what the library is capable. You can easily create ROC/AUC curves, or residual plots, 

Some examples:

The following three packages have been commented on lesson 19 of the Udemy training course "_Deployment of Machile Learning Models_" from Soledad Galli.

### [MLextend](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/)

For feature selection and other algorithms like rules mining, there is a python packaged called MLextent. This is also highly very recommendable as you can integrate the procedures in MLextend very easily as part of the machine learning pipeline.

### [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/)

For feature engineering

### [Feature Engine](https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine)

You can take full advantage of many feature engineering steps that share the same fit transform functionality from scikit-learn
feature selection and other algorithms like rules mining.

### [ModelDB](https://mitdbg.github.io/modeldb/)

ModelDB provides powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing the results of models. This segment will explore how to use the ModelDB user interface to understand how models are performing during training (e.g. impact of hyperparameters and pre-processing steps), and to monitor deployed models.

This library is used on the "_Monitoring and Improving the Performance of Machine Learning Models_" by
Manasi VartakJason Slepicka course that is part of O'Reilly media.- 

### [kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Kedro is a development workflow framework which aims to become the industry standard for developing production-ready code. Kedro helps structure your data pipeline using software engineering principles, eliminating project delays due to code rewrites and thereby providing more time to focus on building robust pipelines. Additionally, the framework provides a standardised approach to collaboration for teams building robust, scalable, deployable, reproducible and versioned data pipelines.

### [Feature-engine](https://www.trainindata.com/feature-engine)

Feature Engine allows you to design and store a feature engineering pipeline with bespoke procedures for different variable groups.
